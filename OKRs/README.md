# libp2p Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

We managed the libp2p project using a combination of Github issues, Waffle boards ([go](https://waffle.io/libp2p/go-libp2p), [js](https://waffle.io/libp2p/js-libp2p)) and quarterly OKRs for higher level planning.

Below is an archive of our quarterly OKRs.  We align with the calendar quarter, updating the sheet as the quarter proceeds to add mid-quarter and final scores.
