# libp2p Project Management

This repo is used for project management, coordination and notes archiving for the libp2p project.  It will grow over time.

# The libp2p Project

In 2018, we are trying to turn libp2p into a true first class citizen of a project, with its own goals, team and organizational structure.  Previously, libp2p had been mainly an upstream for IPFS, but recently more non-IPFS downstream projects have started adopting it, hence the desire to "spin out" libp2p as a proper independent project.

This entails a few changes:

* Creation of a libp2p Working Group (WG).  Eventually, we hope to have sub-WG's for different parts of libp2p.
* Roadmap, goals, Kanban tracking.  [@mgoelzer](https://github.com/mgoelzer) is working on putting more structure in place to help guide libp2p's development.
* User focus beyond IPFS.  [@mgoelzer](https://github.com/mgoelzer) is working on product management tasks such as interviewing downstream users to understand what they need from libp2p.
* Greater interaction between contributors.  We will be trying a bi-weekly meeting (see below) and a libp2p Summit in Berlin in July 2018.

# Bi-weekly Call

We are planning to start a bi-weekly libp2p call every other **Thursday** at 17:00-17:30 UTC (10:00-10:30am PDT).  The first call will occur Thursday May 3, 2018.

Join the call here:  https://zoom.us/j/405235579

Each call has an agenda in the [agendas folders](https://github.com/libp2p/pm/tree/master/agendas).
