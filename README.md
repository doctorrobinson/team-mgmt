# libp2p Project Management

This repo is used for project management, coordination and notes archiving for the libp2p project.  It will grow over time.

# The libp2p Project

In 2018, we are trying to turn libp2p into a true first class citizen of a project, with its own goals, team and organizational structure.  Previously, libp2p had been mainly an upstream for IPFS, but recently more non-IPFS downstream projects have started adopting it, hence the desire to "spin out" libp2p as a proper independent project.

This entails a few changes:

* Creation of a libp2p Working Group (WG).  Eventually, we hope to have sub-WG's for different parts of libp2p.
* Roadmap, goals, Kanban tracking.  [@mgoelzer](https://github.com/mgoelzer) is working on putting more structure in place to help guide libp2p's development.
* User focus beyond IPFS.  [@mgoelzer](https://github.com/mgoelzer) is working on product management tasks such as interviewing downstream users to understand what they need from libp2p.
* Greater interaction between contributors.  We will be trying a bi-weekly meeting (see below) and a libp2p Summit in Berlin in July 2018.

# Bi-weekly call

We are planning to start a bi-weekly libp2p call every other **Monday at 10:30-11:00am U.S. Pacific Time**.  [Add to your calendar](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NDV0MGFlMmJlYnNyaHBkMGI4M3NqMG5nZGdfMjAxODA2MThUMTczMDAwWiBsaWJwMnAuaW9fMHE5NjgyaTN0ZTdlYW5oZTlxN2FlMWM1OGdAZw&tmsrc=libp2p.io_0q9682i3te7eanhe9q7ae1c58g%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL) with this link.
