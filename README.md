# Bi-weekly Call

We are planning to start a bi-weekly libp2p call every other **Thursday** at 17:00-17:30 UTC (10:00-10:30am PDT).  The first call will occur Thursday May 3, 2018.

The main goal of the call is for each person to say what they are working on.  Additional topics may be listed in each call's agenda docunment in the [agendas folders](https://github.com/libp2p/pm/tree/master/agendas).
